# Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend 

In this milestone, the backend for the e-commerce application was set up, connecting it to a database and implementing basic error handling. 

**Backend Folder Structure:**

- controllers/
- models/
- routes/: Contains API route definitions.
- middleware/: Manages middleware functions like error handling.
- utils/: Contains reusable utility functions.
- config/: Stores environment and database configuration files.

**Server Setup**
- A Node.js server was created using Express.
- The server was configured to listen on a designated port (default: 5000).
- API endpoints were set up to handle basic requests.
 
 **Database Connection**
- Integrated MongoDB as the primary database for efficient data storage.
- Successfully established a connection to MongoDB using Mongoose.
- Ensured database connection parameters were stored securely using dotenv.

**Error Handling**

- Implemented basic error-handling middleware to provide clear and helpful error messages.
- Added fallback logic to handle uncaught errors and invalid route.

# Milestone 4: User Model, Controller & File Uploads

In this milestone, we:
- Created the User Model using MongoDB schemas to define how user data (name, email, password, etc.) is structured in the database.

- Developed the User Controller to handle user-related operations like adding a new user and retrieving user details.

- Implemented Multer to enable file uploads, allowing users to upload profile pictures and store them in the backend.

# Milestone 5

- Built a Sign-Up Page using HTML and CSS.
- Added input fields for Name, Email, and Password.
- Implemented form validation to ensure correct data entry.
- Checked email format and password security criteria.
- Ensured a clean and user-friendly UI for better user experience.

# Milestone 6 

- Used bcrypt to encrypt passwords before saving them in the database.
- Ensured passwords are not stored in plain text for better security.
- Stored complete user data (name, email, hashed password) securely.
- Enhanced data protection to prevent password theft and unauthorized access.
- Followed security best practices to comply with privacy regulations

# Milestone 7

In this milestone, we implemented secure login authentication by validating user credentials during the login process. We created a login endpoint that accepts the user's email/username and password.

- The backend retrieves user data from the database based on the provided email/username. If the user does not exist, an appropriate error message is returned.
- For password validation, we used bcrypt to compare the entered password with the stored hashed password.
- If the passwords match, the user is successfully authenticated; otherwise, an error is sent.
- This approach ensures passwords remain encrypted and secure, preventing unauthorized access and enhancing data protection.

By following security best practices, we strengthened authentication and ensured compliance with standards like GDPR and PCI-DSS

# Milestone 31: Implementing Redux for Global State Management 

**Learning Goals:**
- Learn how to use Redux for global state management in React
- Implement a Redux store to manage global application state
- Store and access user email across the entire application

**Key Concepts:**
- **Store:** The single source of truth for your application state
- **Reducer:** Pure function that specifies how the state changes in response to actions
- **Actions:** Plain JavaScript objects that describe what happened
- **Provider:** Makes the Redux store available to any nested components

**Note:** In the next milestone, you'll learn how to:
1. Dispatch the `setEmail` action to update the global state
2. Access the email state from any component using `useSelector`
